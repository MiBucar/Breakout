# Breakout
Breakout game for Gamepires

Breakout game with 3 levels, levels are dynamical which means all you have to do to change the look of the level(bricks, columns, rows etc..) is to change the
settings in the XML file. There is a feature in the game that allows you to break any brick on the ball's path if you hit it directly with the middle of the 
paddle. If the ball hits the left side of the paddle, its direction will change to the left, if its hits the right side of the paddle, its direction will
change to the right.
